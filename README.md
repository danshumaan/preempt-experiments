# preempt
This is a modular version of Pr系系mpt, meant to be used as part of other projects. 

For the experiments and results found in [Pr系系mpt: Sanitizing Sensitive Prompts for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05147), please refer to the `main` branch.
## Setup
Install libraries in a Python 3.11.4 virtual environment with `requirements.txt`.

## NER models
We currently support [Universal NER](https://universal-ner.github.io/) and [Llama-3 8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) for NER. 

We will add support for including your own NER models in the near future. 

## Usage
Usage examples can be found in `demo.ipynb`

We currently only support sanitization for names, currency values and age, using either FPE or m-LDP.

We will add support for generalized NER and sanitization in the near future. 

### Extraction
Initialize a `NER` class object by passing the path to one of the supported NER models mentioned above:
```
ner_model = NER("/path/to/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/", device="cuda:0")
```
Extract PII values found in a list of target strings using `ner_model.extract()`:
```
sentences = ["Ben Parker and John Doe went to the bank.", "Who was late today? Adam."]
extracted = ner_model.extract(sentences, entity_type='{Name/Money/Age}')
```

### Sanitization
Initialize a `Sanitizer` class object by passing the previously initialized `ner_model`, a `key` and `tweak` parameter (required for the FF3 cipher used for FPE).
```
sanitizer = Sanitizer(ner_model, key = "EF4359D8D580AA4F7F036D6F04FC6A94", tweak = "D8E7920AFA330A73")
```
Sanitize a list of target strings using `sanitizer.encrypt()`:
```
sanitized_sentences, _ = sanitizer.encrypt(sentences, entity='Name', epsilon=1, use_fpe=True, use_mdp=False)
```
PII values found during NER are stored under `sanitizer.new_entities` as a nested list.

The mappings between plain text and cipher text PII values are stored under `sanitizer.entity_mapping`. FPE will typically extract PII values from the sanitized sentences before decryption.

Sanitized sentences can be desanitized using `sanitizer.decrypt()`:
```
desanitized_sentences = sanitizer.decrypt(sanitized_sentences, entity='Name')
```

#### Sanitizing multiple PII attributes
If you want to sanitize multiple sensitive attributes, create a sanitizer for each category separately.

### Usage tips
NER typically works better when the inputs are smaller. Consider breaking a large chunk of text into smaller sentences when using the sanitizer.
